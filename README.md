> 🚨 WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is a self-bot and is in violation of Discord's and Dank Memer's rules and TOS. By using this software, you acknowledge that we take no responsibility for any action taken against your account, whether by Discord or Dank Memer.
>
> It is crucial that you take appropriate measures to avoid detection. These measures include:
> <ol>
>  <li>Running the bot only in private channels.</li>
>  <li>Not being open about the fact that you use it.</li>
>  <li>If you run the bot excessively, no matter the outcome of captchas. Big surprise, if you farm for 12 hours straight then they might think you're a little bit sussy. So if you script for an unnatural amount of time, then don't be surprised if you get banned for that very reason.</li>
