Follow the steps [here](https://gist.github.com/MarvNC/e601f3603df22f36ebd3102c501116c6#file-get-discord-token-from-browser-md) to get your Discord Token from the Browser Console safely.

## Getting channel ID

Your Chanel ID is needed to specify which channel the self-bot should send commands in. Follow these steps to find and copy your channel ID.

1. **Open Discord Settings**

Open your Discord client, and click on the settings wheel icon in the bottom-left corner. This is in the group of icons that are shown alongside your avatar and Discord username.

2. **Opening Advanced Settings**

Navigate to the left-hand side menu and go to the option that says "Advanced". Click this in order to open up the Advanced Settings pane.

Once the Advanced Settings pane has appeared, this will contain the option to enable Discord Developer mode. If there is a green check mark inside the switch, then it is already enabled, but if there isn't, simply click the toggle to enable Developer Mode.

3. **Navigate to the Channel**

Navigate to the discord channel where you want the bot to grind in.
