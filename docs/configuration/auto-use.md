# Auto Use Settings

It is currently not possible to manually add auto use items without [building from source](../installation/build-from-source.md) and editing source code.  Request more items from the [discord server](https://discord.gg/KTrmQnhCHb).&#x20;

## Information

If auto use is on, DMG will send `/profile` every half hour to check what auto use items are active, and use inactive ones. It also uses items when receiving a DM about an item expiring.

## Current auto use items:

* Hunting rifle
* Shovel
* Life savers
